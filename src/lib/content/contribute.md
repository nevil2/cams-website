# CONTRIBUTING

We are actively looking for volunteers willing to contribute the development of the growing suite of applications.

<!-- Clubs using our software are naturally concerned about future development, support and maintenance.  If we can find people who can support different aspects of our applications, our users will be more comfortable. -->

New volunteers may also bring new ideas, knowledge and skills.

The applications use a variety of different technologies, deployed in a variety of different ways.  Technological choices been based on our expertise, a desire to adopt modern approaches, the experience of those co-operating, and that of those who might become involved in the future.

The breadth of applications, technologies and deployment method means that a volunteer, whether a professional developer or an interested amateur, could find something that they are comfortable helping with, and learn and try out something new. 

We are particularly interested in creating a pool of volunteers willing to support front-end websites built with [![image alt h](svelte-logo.svg)](https://svelte.dev/) **Svelte**, [![alt h](tailwindcss-logo.svg)](https://tailwindcss.com/),
[![alt h](typescript-logo.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) **Typescript**,
**HTML** and **CSS**.  We are happy to teach inexperienced amateurs how to use them.



<!-- Nevil is both keen to learn new skills from professionals, and happy to teach inexperienced amateurs with a suitable background. -->
