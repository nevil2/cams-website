### Climbing Wikis

These provide large amounts of free information to climbers, and as such are very popular.

However, they pose some risks if they replace (and undermine) other sources of information:
- competing wikis with different geographic strengths
- ownership is typically private commercial organisations and can change
- reliability of information is dependant on contributors and moderators and is variable
- historical information on first ascents is often missing or incorrect
- topo are often absent, which is challenge for areas not covered by definitive guidebook



### Selective Guidebooks

Selective Guidebooks are understandably popular and increasingly outselling or replacing definitive guidebooks.

Whilst the guidebook themselves can be excellent, the overall trend could lead to less comprehensive information being available to climbers in future.
