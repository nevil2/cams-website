## New Route Reporting

This is a separate application which collects new crag and route information from the public.

The application is embedded in participating clubs websites.  It includes TopoEditor for creating topos with the new route(s).

The submissions are moderated by the club moderator and subsequently transferred electronically into the Club's main routes database.

To date, thousands of routes have been collected and managed through this application.

Clubs can publish the data, topos and comments in their websites (see below). 

The Scottish Mountaineering Club are also published annually submissions in the new routes sections of their Journal.

## New Route Site

A separate application enables public access to the routes information.

This is typically embedded within a club website and is used to publish information on all routes not in current guidebooks.  For the SMC, this is about 9500 routes.

The Alpine Club use it to provide full access to Alpine route information to members.
