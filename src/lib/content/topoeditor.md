The TopoEditor is: 
- possibly the world's most advanced tool dedicated to creating climbing topos.
- integrated into the Routes Database applications and New route submission processes
- available as a [free online tool](https://topoeditor.com) for anyone to use.


**It is now available as a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) for third parties to integrate it into their web applications.**

The [SMC New Route Reporting](https://www.smc.org.uk/climbs/submission) is an example of integration into a SvelteKit website.
