## Custom Design & Functionality

Whilst each club webiste is built on common principles and reuseable bits of code, each club website has its own code base which belongs to that club.

This enables the graphic design of the website to be tailored to the requirements of that club and its branding.  The original design is typically done by a designer chosen by the club.

Whilst clubs have common requirements in terms of functionality, each club has slightly different requirements as to what they need, and how the processes should work.  As such, all functionality is adapted to the specific needs of the club.

## Strapi CMS

The Strapi CMS enables:

- different authorisation rules to apply to members and different club officials 
- non-technical club officials create and update website content, including new pages
- administrators to do most tasks through the front-end website
- developers and administrations to access underlying records (e.g. hut bookings)
- management of payments through Stripe and GoCardless
- confirmation and information emails to be sent 

As such, it is acting as both a CMS and an administration system

## Philosophy

Each Club owns its own site and code base whilst potentially benefiting from a common approach:
 - Common solutions
 - Reuseable code
 - Secure transfer between clubs (e.g. for shop or bookings)
 - Cross fertilisation (ideas, improvements, bugs)
 - Cross club support / maintenance

Our approach aims to provide:
 - Reduced Club Admin
 - Reduced Presure on Web Manager (easy updating of content through STRAPI)
 - Better functionality
 - Design Freedom for better branding
 - Faster and more responsive website
 - Lower Maintenance
