## New Route Reporting

This is a separate application which collects new crag and route information from the public.

The SMC submissions are moderated by the SMC New Route Editors, and subsequently transferred electronically into the main routes database.

The SMC submissions are also published annually in the new routes sections of the SMC Journal.

To date, some 2000 routes have been collected and managed through this application.

Increasingly, submissions are accompanied by a topo created with TopoEditor.

The [submissions page](https://www.smc.org.uk/climbs/submission) has now been integrated into the SMC main website.

## New Route Site

A separate SMC site was created to enable public access to the new routes submissions (about 9500 routes).

The frontend used ![alt h](react-logo.svg) [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The backend uses [![alt h](fastapi-logo.svg) FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) / [![alt h](pydantic-logo.svg) Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) / [![alt h](sqlalchemy-logo.png)](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) / [![alt h](python-logo.svg)](https://www.python.org/).

The [frontend](https://www.smc.org.uk/climbs/newroutes) has been integrated into the SMC website (required converting code to Svelte).
