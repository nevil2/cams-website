### Vision

![image alt L](Photo_2_from_Roger.jpg)

The project started in 2020 with the vision to create a climber-owned UK routes database with better coverage, data accuracy and first ascent information. 

With guidebooks increasingly being selective, there is an increasing need for digital route descriptions, first ascent information and topos for crags and climbs excluded from print.

Wikis, such as ![alt h](ukc_logo.svg) [UK Climbing](https://www.ukclimbing.com/), whilst a great resource, will not fill this need.

The application developed for the [![alt l](smc_logo.svg) Scottish Mountaineering Club](https://smc.org.uk) and [![alt l](CC_logo_header.svg)](https://www.climbers-club.co.uk/) now encompasses around **half the routes in mainland Britain**.



### Supporting Climbing Clubs

![image alt N](Photo_3_from_Roger.jpg)

In addition to supporting clubs with their guidebook publishing, software has been developed for:

 - [![alt l](SMC_Horiz_BLK.svg)](https://smc.org.uk) and [![alt l](PC_logo.svg)](https://pinnacleclub.co.uk) club websites
 - [![alt l](SMC_Horiz_BLK.svg) Munro Compleators](https://smc.org.uk/hills/submission)
 - [![alt l](AC_logo_colour.svg) Himalayan Index](https://ac-hi.topoeditor.com/)
 <!-- - [Interclub Hut Booking System](https://hut-booking.pages.dev/) -->



### Ownership
 - either the software is licenced or provided to Climbing Clubs free of charge
 - or is available for free online use (as per [TopoEditor](https://topoeditor.com))
 - in the future, it may be that some software will be made open source
 - or that some new software may be subject to licencing fee (if commercial development or support is required)

All code is stored on [![alt h](gitlab-logo.svg) GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [![alt h](github-mark.svg) GitHub](https://github.com/).

<center style="color: red;">We are not a commercial organisation and do not make money from this venture</center>
