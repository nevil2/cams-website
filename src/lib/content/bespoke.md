## Himalayan Index

A [replacement](https://hi.alpineclub.org/) for the [Alpine Club's](http://alpineclub.org/) Himalyan Index is in development (currently member only).

This enables remote updating on the database by a variety of volunteers, and for member (public in future) submission of comments and photos.

It is a stand-alone SvelteKit website, supported by a separate Hono server using D1 database and R2 storage (all deployed on cloudflare).
