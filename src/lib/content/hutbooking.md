## Interclub Hut Booking System and Website

Work has started on creating an [Interclub Hut Booking System](https://hut-booking.pages.dev/).

The objectives are:

 - to build one solution that is appropriate for many clubs (less work and maintenance)
 - to facilitate booking kindred club huts (increases club revenues, improves member service)
 - enable payment online (reduces administration, improves cashflow)


### Technology

[![Svelte logo LL](svelte-logo.svg)](https://svelte.dev/) **Svelte**,
[![alt h](svelte-kit-logo.svg)](https://kit.svelte.dev/), 
[![alt h](tailwindcss-logo.svg)](https://tailwindcss.com/),
[![alt h](typescript-logo.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) **Typescript**,
**HTML** and **CSS**.

### Deployment

[![alt l](cloudflare-logo.svg)](https://www.cloudflare.com/) offers a complete set of 'serverless' Cloud Services on its free tier:

- Pages for delivering website (500 website builds per month)
- Workers for API functions to access/update stored data (100k requests per day)
- D1 for storing data in SQL database (1GB allowance)
- R2 for storing images / documents / backups in S3 storage (10GB allowance)
- Email through MailChannels

Cloudflare approach is much more efficient (and responsive) than traditional 'serverless'.  The prototype deployment will help assess whether it can meet all the projects needs.
