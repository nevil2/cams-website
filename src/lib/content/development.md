## Routes Database

The main development has been undertaken by [Nevil Hewitt (developer) and Roger Everett (content manager)](/people).

Roger maintains a WhatsApp group for users of the Routes Database to share questions, answers and information.  

## Club Websites

The original development of each website has been a cooperation between Nevil Hewitt (developer), a project manager
and a team of contributors, administrators and testers.


## Going Forward

The target is to reduce key dependencies and spread the load between volunteers.  This is easier now that the ground work of standardising the technical solutions has been completed.

### Club Teams

Each club has a two teams of people:
1. For development, content creation and support of their website
2. For creation and maintenance of content in their Routes Database application.

### Inter-club Website Working Group

Established by Ann Blanford in late 2023, it is helping to share priorities and solutions between the clubs.

### Routes Database Working Group

Established by Nevil Hewitt in late 2025 with the objective of gradually taking on the technical management of the Routes Database software.
